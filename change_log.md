2026-02-15 21:00:00 Refactored ToDoTool and ToolManager: removed ToDoTool._update_system_context and replaced it with a static parse_todo_list method. ToolManager now directly reads the todo file from the file system to sync session_context after sandbox execution, ensuring reliable state updates in isolated environments.
2026-02-15 21:30:00 Fixed AttributeError in TaskObservationAgent by replacing non-existent tool_manager.get_tool_config with get_openai_tools. Verified AgentBase._execute_tool compatibility with ToolProxy via get_tool.
2026-02-15 22:00:00 Optimized ToDoTool: updated todo_write to support partial updates. Existing tasks only require id and changed fields, while new tasks require content.
2026-02-15 22:30:00 Updated sage_cli.py: Removed deprecated --no-multi-agent argument. Added --deepthink argument to explicitly enable deep thinking mode, alongside existing configuration options.
